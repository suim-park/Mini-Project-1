## Mini Project 1_Create a Python GitHub Template :page_facing_up:</br> 

## :ballot_box_with_check: Requirements
* .devcontainer configuration for a Python environment
* Makefile with commands for setup, testing, and linting
* GitHub Actions for CI/CD
* requirements.txt for project dependencies
* README.md with setup and usage instructions


## :ballot_box_with_check: To-do List
* __GitHub repository__: Create a Python GitHub Template in GitHub repository</br>
* __Link to successful GitHub Action run__: Confirm whether GitHub Action has been executed successfully</br>

## :ballot_box_with_check: In-Progess
1. A basic Python template has been created. The main.py file includes a simple add function, and test_main.py verifies that the function works as expected. You can build upon this template to make further progress. This serves as a foundational baseline for your future projects.
```Python

```
3. The Makefile streamlines commands for setup, testing, linting, and formatting, enabling a smooth development workflow.
4. The requirements.txt file ensures that necessary libraries are installed automatically.
5. The cicd.yml file defines a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to validate the workflow.
